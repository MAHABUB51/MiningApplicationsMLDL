Project 1 :
Water Potability Analysis Using Machine Learning(Water Potability.ipynb):

This project focuses on predicting the potability of water using machine learning algorithms. The goal is to classify water samples as either potable (safe to drink) or non-potable (unsafe to drink) based on various water quality features.


Project 2:
Predictive Modeling and Data Analysis on Mining Applications Dataset(Mineral_Deposits_Prediction.ipynb):

This project focuses on the prediction of mineral deposits using machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms. The goal is to analyze geological data and develop a predictive model that can help in identifying potential mineral deposit sites.

Project 3:
Compressive_Strength_Prediction.ipynb

This project aims to predict the compressive strength of concrete using machine learning techniques. The goal is to develop a model that can estimate the strength of concrete based on its composition and curing time, aiding in the construction industry for better material design and quality control.
