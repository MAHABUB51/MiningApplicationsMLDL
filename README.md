Mineral Deposits Prediction
This project focuses on the prediction of mineral deposits using machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms. The goal is to analyze geological data and develop a predictive model that can help in identifying potential mineral deposit sites.

Features
Data preprocessing and feature engineering
Application of various machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest, XGBoost, and deep learning models (e.g., Neural Networks)
Evaluation of model performance using appropriate metrics
Visualization of geological data and model predictions
Technologies Used:
Python
Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
TensorFlow/Keras (for deep learning models)
Matplotlib, Seaborn (for data visualization)
