Project 1 :
Water Potability Analysis Using Machine Learning(Water Potability.ipynb):
This project focuses on predicting the potability of water using machine learning algorithms. The goal is to classify water samples as either potable (safe to drink) or non-potable (unsafe to drink) based on various water quality features.


Project 2:
Predictive Modeling and Data Analysis on Mining Applications Dataset(Mineral_Deposits_Prediction.ipynb):
This project focuses on the prediction of mineral deposits using machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms. The goal is to analyze geological data and develop a predictive model that can help in identifying potential mineral deposit sites.
